# CS408 Final Project

## Project Spec

### General Theme
Endless runner web game.

### Functionality
This game will start off as your typical endless runner game, similar to that of google's, when you have no interenet and you are able to start an endless runner playing as the dinosaur. Inheritely, there isn't much that it offers, except (hopefully) fun and enjoyment as a past-time. For our competitive players, there is a leaderboard of all concurrent and past players to raise in the ranks, as well as a player stat page to view individual profiles and statistics.

### Audience
The audience is going to be the general public here. This isn't intended to be a very complicated game, but one that is simple, engaging, and eventually challenging.

### Data Management
The idea is to have each player have, but not limited to, one player id to which they can use to record their stats. Meaning every time a user enters their player ID, they may play as that profile and the stats will be recorded after a play session. As for the actual data, there should be a high score, player id (username), last obstacle hit, and possibly a "last score" which would be there most recent play session's score. All this data will be fetched for leaderboard placement, or profile stats.

### Future Implementations
- Time tracking
- Speed increase relative to time survived
- Reasonable obstacle generation (no impossible situations for the player)
- Create enemies (moving obstacles)
- Customizable characters
